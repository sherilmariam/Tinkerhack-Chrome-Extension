UTILITY CHROME EXTENSION

This extension contains modules which improves user productivity

1. If multiple files of the same file name are downloaded , the system doesn't prompt the user about the multiple downloads instead
the system automatically renames it and resumes the download.This particular scenario generates 
duplicate files with same content but a different file name. This Chrome extension prompts the user of multiple downloads within the same folder.

The stack used for this Chrome Extension building is JavaScript.

To use this chrome extension download the file and load the unpacked extension. 

This project doesn't have any bugs. Currently we are building codes to check the file contents so that the user would get a detailed
analysis of the content inside files with the same file name constraint.
