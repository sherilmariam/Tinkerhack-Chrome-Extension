UTILITY CHROME EXTENSION

This extension contains modules which improves user productivity

1.If multiple files of same file name are downloaded , the system doesn't prompt the user about the multiple download instead
the system automatically renames it and resumes the download.This particular scenario generates 
duplicate files with same content but different file name.This chrome extension prompts the user of multiple downloads within same folder.

The stack used for this Chrome Extension building is JavScript.

Inorder to use it the user needs to download the chrome extension and should enable it.This extension is currently not uploaded in Web Store .

This project doesn't have any bugs.Currently we are building codes to check the file contents so that the user would get a detailed
analysis of the content inside files with same file name constraint.

2.Clipboard module
